# Chart Component Objectives & Design Requirements

## Core Objectives

- Extract and visualize user opinion about the market (volatility, drift) in financial terms.
- Educate users about financial concepts (volatility, drift, geometric Brownian motion) through interactive visualization.
- Make financial modeling accessible to non-experts by guiding them with simple questions and visual feedback.

## Design Requirements

- The chart must be interactive and allow users to adjust prediction ranges directly on the graph.
- The chart must support multiple time granularities (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months) and allow users to switch between them easily.
- The chart state (data, overlays, user predictions) must be accessible and updatable by other components (e.g., chat, direct input, stats, overlays).
- The chart must be able to display overlays, such as user predictions, statistical lines, and other annotations, and allow other components to add/remove these overlays.
- The chart should support zooming and panning, and display all available data points at the selected granularity (hourly, daily, etc.).
- The chart should be visually clean, with a neutral background and clear separation of overlays, lines, and user input areas.
- The chart should be performant and able to handle long time series (e.g., 3 months of hourly data) without UI lag.

## Extensibility

- The chart architecture should allow for future addition of more advanced tools (trendlines, custom overlays, etc.)
- The chart should be easy to integrate with chat-driven workflows and direct expert input.
